Ideas for StoryLines

DEMO

Hello everyone, our names our Shree, Ana$ta$ia "White Privilege" Klonow$ki, and Mansi, and, in accordance with the University of Pittsburgh's Year of Diversity, we would like to introduce our app [ENTER APP NAME HERE]. 

[ENTER APP NAME HERE] is focused on educating users, like you, about the lives of other people. Take Kyle here for example. Kyle is a 20 year old Caucasian, heterosexual college student who lives in America. --> Shows picture of generic white boy on the screen.

----------FOLLOW ALONG ON SCREEN----------
In the login screen, Kyle would click the "New User" button, and enter in his Age, Ethnicity, Gender, Orientation, and Country where he lives. He would then see that he got the character...Anjali, a high school student! Now some of you may be wondering, why did Kyle get Anjali as his character and not someone that resembles him?

That is because [ENTER APP NAME HERE] is focused on educating you about the lives of other people through putting you in those people's shoes.

Kyle would then click the "Next" button, which would lead him to the instruction screen, where he can see that he will get the opportunity to live a day in the life of Anjali, answering Yes or No questions to progress through the story and swiping Right for Yes and Left for No.

Now, we're going to see Anastasia (OR MANSI) go through the story.

----------ANJALI'S STORY----------

1. Anjali woke up from her bed in Chennai, India.                       --> Would you like to go to school today?     YES
2. Anjali got ready for school. As she's packing her backpack,          --> Do you put on the skin bleaching cream?   NO

   FAIR AND LOVELY! How are you going to find a husband if your
   skin is not light?"
3. Anjali goes to school and see's her friend Roja. "Hey Anjali,"       --> Would you like to pursue a major in       NO
   Roja says. "So, do you know you want to do in college yet?               college that you don't like to please
   I've decided to become a doctor." "I thought you wanted to               your parents?

   consider artists to be successfull..."

   parents want you to be one?" Roja asks. "No, I'm going to be             want to be?
   a writer," says Anjali. "And I'm going to tell them that today!"
5. "You want to be a writer and not a doctor? How do you expect         --> Do you still want to be a writer?         YES

   disappointed in you. You have never seen your father look this

   **** Before answering the next question, pause****

As you can see, the goal of the app isn't to see if you make the most moral decisions, but to illuminate upon the actual choices that certain individuals face in their countries, and let the user compare the consequences of these choices between their character's life and their own life, thus education the user on the lives of other people.

   ****Answer the question****
   
9. Anjali goes to sleep crying. She has never seen her parents this     --> Do you rescind your previous choices?     NO
   distraught before.     
   
   End of Story Screen --> Go back to Main Menu? --> YES

----------BACK TO PRESENTATION----------

In order to build this app, we utilized Swift iOS coding, Parse, and Amazon Web Services to store the usernames and passwords of the app users, as can be seen here --> shows on the screen the Parse AWS page and the various usernames and passwords

Throughout the construction of the app, we made sure to get User Input, as can be seen from this video of a user testing the app --> Has short clip of someone trying the app and offering advice

And using the advice, we fixed the issues with the app that the user found. We also conducted a survey on how many people would use the app if it was available on the Apple App Store, and (THIS MANY PEOPLE WOULD USE IT), which shows that people truly believe that this app concept could truly educate people on the lives of other's, encouraging diversity and open minds.

Although Anjali's story is the only fully completed storyline in the app, she is not the only character we have created [SHOWS LIST OF CHARACTERS WE HAVE CREATED] and we hope to continue working on this project past SheInnovates and add storylines for each of these characters!

Thank you and listening to our presentation.
